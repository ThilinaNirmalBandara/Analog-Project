# Analog Voice-Over Circuit with Channel Prioritization

This project demonstrates a fully analog implementation of a voice-over circuit capable of handling two audio channels.

## Key Features
- **Channel Prioritization**:  
  Automatically prioritizes one channel when an input is detected.  

- **Volume Control**:  
  Independent volume adjustments for both channels.  

- **Detection Threshold**:  
  Adjustable threshold value for audio detection.  

- **Purely Analog Design**:  
  Designed using basic analog components and ICs, without relying on digital processors.
