Analog Voice-Over Circuit with Channel Prioritization
This project demonstrates a fully analog implementation of a voice-over circuit capable of handling two audio channels. Key features include:

Channel Prioritization: One channel automatically takes priority when an input is detected.
Volume Control: Volume adjustments for both channels.
Detection threshold : Adjustable threshold value for audio detection
Purely Analog Design: Achieved using basic analog components and ICs without relying on digital processors.
